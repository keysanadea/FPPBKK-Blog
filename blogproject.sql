(2, 2, 'Benefits and Advantages of Going Vegetarian', 'Benefits-and-Advantages-of-Going-Vegetarian', '<p>Vegetarian, vegan, plant-based, all similar terms with some distinct differences. It can be confusing to know which approach is the best for you, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to make some healthy changes. This article examines the differences between these diets and looks at the available research on the benefits of making the switch to a diet that is focused primarily on plants (and may or may not eschew meat altogether).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of Plant-based Diets<br />\r\nVegetarian diets usually include all fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and may include eggs and dairy products. All of these diets typically exclude all meats (flesh). Plant-based is an encompassing term for vegan and vegetarian diets that are defined by the type or frequency of animal product(s) consumed. There also are subsets within these diets, which are defined by the types of animal-based products that are consumed or avoided:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian: Consumes eggs and dairy products<br />\r\nLacto-vegetarian: Consumes dairy products<br />\r\nOvo-vegetarian: Consumes eggs<br />\r\nPescetarian: Consumes fish<br />\r\nSemi-vegetarian: Occasionally consumes meat (once or twice per week) or excludes all red meat<br />\r\nFlexitarian: Rarely consumes meat (once or twice per month)<br />\r\nVegan: Does not consume any animal products<br />\r\nGiven this range of plant-based classifications, it can be difficult to determine from the available research exactly which types provide the most health benefits. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), for example, takes years to develop, so a well-controlled, short-term study cannot adequately assess CVD risk. Therefore, we must rely on examining the correlations between dietary habits and health factors. Overall, a well-planned and executed vegetarian diet can provide adequate nutrition, promote overall health and lower the risk of major chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the specific health benefits of following a plant-based diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefit #1: Increased Healthy Food Intake<br />\r\nEating a variety of vegetables and whole fruits is a key recommendation of healthy eating patterns. A varied consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, legumes and nuts at an appropriate calorie level usually leads to an adequate intake of dietary fiber and a low intake of saturated fat and hydrogenated vegetable oils. As a result, vegetarians commonly have lower body mass indexes (BMI), LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure and reduced rates of stroke, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and death from heart diseasethan do non-vegetarians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, vegetarian eating patterns are rich in health-promoting phytochemicals and vitamins C and E, which function as antioxidants to protect against oxidative stress. Additionally, these eating patterns provide magnesium and potassium rich foods which can improve insulin sensitivity and vascular function, respectively The dietary fiber along with phytochemicals can help improve and maintain gut the microbiome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To summarize, potential mechanisms for improved health from vegetarian eating plans include weight loss/maintenance, blood sugar control, improved lipid profile, reduced blood pressure, decreased inflammation and improved gut health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefit #2: Decreased Unhealthy Food Intake<br />\r\nSeveral dietary factors in animal foods have been associated with increased risk of CVD. Historically, saturated fats, prevalent in meats, have been linked to elevated cholesterol and other unfavorable disease risk profiles. Interestingly, saturated fats themselves may not be responsible for many of the adverse health effects that they have been associated with, but rather the processing of meats may be at fault. Consuming preservatives in processed meats, such as sodium, nitrates and nitrites, may raise blood pressure and impair insulin response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most research shows a sliding scale of improved health outcomes from increased plant intake with decreased meat intake. Completely eliminating meat and dairy products may not be necessary for good health, however, as they can be part of a healthy eating pattern. Choosing whole foods over processed foods also is an important strategy for maximizing the health benefits from any diet plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going Vegetarian<br />\r\nAs mentioned, the term &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, as vegetarians exhibit diverse dietary practices. Here are some suggestions for making the shift toward a plant-based diet:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gradually reduce animal food intake, as this method is easier to adopt and adhere to than more extreme recommendations, such as completely excluding all animal products.<br />\r\nStart with a few plant-based meals per week and build toward creating a sustainable habit.<br />\r\nIncorporate a theme into your meal planning. For example, you could start with &ldquo;Meatless Mondays&rdquo; and gradually expand the idea to include two to three days per week. Or try &ldquo;Vegan Before 6,&rdquo; which is an approach that allows meat and animal products only at dinner.<br />\r\nConsider sustainability in how it applies to the longevity of a diet plan. For example, following a semi-vegetarian eating plan is likely to be easier to maintain than a strict vegan plan over a long period of time.<br />\r\nUnderstand that healthy eating is a lifestyle, not a 30-day challenge.<br />\r\nThe Wrong Way to Follow a Vegetarian Diet<br />\r\nAs with any diet plan, there are healthy and less-healthy versions of vegetarianism, and being any type of vegetarian by name does not guarantee the health benefits discussed earlier. &nbsp;Soda, cookies, French fries, macaroni and cheese, and sugary cereals are all vegetarian foods. Certainly, a vegetarian diet can be high in calories, sugar, preservatives and unhealthy fats. Also, strict vegetarian diets can omit certain nutrients, primarily omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. Constructing a healthy vegetarian diet includes meal planning and preparation to avoid missing out on important nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plant-based diet may also need to include fortified foods (i.e., vitamins and minerals added to the product) and potentially supplementation. Vitamin B12, specifically, is only obtainable through animal foods or dietary supplements. Eggs and milk, however, contain B12; thus, a lacto-ovo-vegetarian will have fewer nutrient gaps to fill than a vegan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summary<br />\r\nConsuming adequate amounts of vegetables and fruits is, in fact, the strongest correlate with reduced disease risks, particularly CVD (USDA, 2015). A healthy diet (including or excluding meat products) should include more vegetables and fewer processed foods. Regardless of which dietary approach you follow, make healthy eating a lifestyle that you can follow for years to come.</p>\r\n', 'ca1cd0bb8bbac8df41ad1dafa13f562b.png', '2020-11-01 21:17:59', 1, '2020-11-02 01:47:59', NULL),

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts are meant to challenge the entire body and push intensity limits. While the intensity is meant to be high, adjusting for the energy level you have and/or injuries you may be experiencing is perfectly appropriate and recommended. HIIT training can be either high- or low-impact or a combination of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following HIIT workout can be completed in 30 minutes and requires no extra equipment. When applicable, dumbbells may be used to add variety and challenge to certain exercises. The exercises are based on time instead of repetitions, as individual speeds will vary based on your fitness level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warm-up: Perform five minutes of moderate-intensity movement, such as walking briskly, jogging or riding a stationary bike. A quick and easy way to determine if you are working at a moderate intensity is to use the talk test.&nbsp; If you can talk comfortably while exercising or can talk but not sing you are most likely at a moderate intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perform each exercise for one minute followed by a two-minute recovery. The work portion should be challenging yet sustainable. For the recovery segment, perform low-intensity movements, such as walking at a slow or leisurely pace or slow jogging. The idea is to recover while continuing to move. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Butt Kickers (1 minute):&nbsp;</strong>High- or low-intensity, bring your heels up to your glutes; rest for 2 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mountain Climbers (1 minute):&nbsp;</strong>From a plank position, walk or run your feet toward your chest; rest for 2 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alternating Lunge (1 minute):</strong>&nbsp;Walk into a forward lunge or jump to transition (or do a combination of speeds); rest for 2 minutes. For increased challenge, add dumbbell biceps curls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walk Out to Push-up (1 minute):</strong>&nbsp;From a standing position, place hands on the floor and walk out into a plank position. Perform a push on your toes or knees and then walk back up to a standing position; rest for 2 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hip Bridge to Crunch (1 minute):</strong>&nbsp;From a seated position with feet flat on the floor, place hands behind you on the floor. Push up into a hip bridge, keeping your head in alignment with the spine. Drop the hips back down and through your hands for spinal flexion (crunch); rest for 2 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alternating Curtsey Lunges (1 minute):</strong>&nbsp;Bring one leg back into a lunge att a diagonal behind you. Keep the toes and knee of your front leg tracking in the same direction. Repeat on the other side and then rest for 2 minutes. For increased challenge, add dumbbell lateral raises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cool-down:</strong>&nbsp;Perform five minutes of low-intensity movement and stretching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, HIIT training means high-intensity effort for a short period of time.

(7, 3, '5 Simple Habits to Make You Healthier and Happier', '5-Simple-Habits-to-Make-You-Healthier-and-Happier', '<p>Happiness has become a popular field of study for researchers over the last decade, and universities are creating whole courses around the topic. Dr. Laurie Santos, a professor in psychology and cognitive science, teaches a hugely popular course on happiness at Yale and is a leading researcher on the science of happiness. Through her research, she has developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/exercise-science/\">science-based</a>&nbsp;recommendations on how we can increase our happiness levels. Here are five simple ways we can create happier, healthier lives for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. List three things you feel grateful for every day</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Santos, writing down three awesome things about your day can have a significant effect on retraining your brain to feel more gratitude and, as a result, feel happier. Pairing this practice with another habit, such as brushing your teeth, can enhance your awareness and make it easier to remember to do each day. Becoming more aware of the things for which you feel grateful&mdash;even small things such as your morning cup of coffee or a call from a friend&mdash;is a great way to help you focus on the positives in your life rather than the things you may perceive to be lacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Get moving</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>People who are physically active for even small amounts of time each week (150 minutes or less) have lower odds for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17111194\">developing depression</a>&nbsp;And the options for adding activity to your day are endless. Take your dog for a walk, for example, or go to a playground and play on the equipment. Practice mobility drills while watching your favorite television show. Find stairs and take them. Go for an easy swim in a lake or work in the garden. The point is to get moving, whenever and wherever you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Spend time in nature and unplug</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The writer Anne Lamott wrote, &ldquo;Almost everything will work again if you&nbsp;unplug&nbsp;it for a few minutes, including you.&rdquo;&nbsp;Taking time away from technology is important, particularly for those who feel overstimulated and fatigued by constant notifications and work-related stress. And if you can unplug outdoors, even better. David Strayer, a professor and cognitive psychologist, has been researching brain-based measures in cognitive restoration and believes that spending time in nature is important for elevating mood and reducing stress. For example, one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/4/272.abstract?sid=56b97a4c-0e75-46d0-a6ba-%20%20%20%20%20%2041c7f41a089c\">study</a>&nbsp;of people walking through an urban green space showed that participants&rsquo; brains exhibited lower frustration, engagement and arousal while in the green area. So get outside without any tech. Again, the possibilities are endless. Walk through a garden. Go hiking. Scramble up some rocks. Run barefoot in the grass. Rent a canoe. Listen and take it all in, allowing nature and its calming effects to wash over you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Take care of others</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Acts of kindness make us happier and spending time caring for others is a great way to increase your happiness level, says Santos. &ldquo;Spending time and money on ourselves isn&rsquo;t as fulfilling as focusing your time and money on other people,&rdquo; Santos explains. &ldquo;Those that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happinesslab.fm/\">volunteer</a>&nbsp;more, tend to be more on the happier side than those that do not volunteer.&rdquo; Pure altruism&mdash;the kind that you want to do rather than feel obligated to&mdash;has long-lasting effects on happiness levels, so take some time to think about issues or causes that speak to you and consider what simple acts you can take to help. Could you offer to go grocery shopping for those who may be unable to leave their homes or take dinner to someone who recently had a baby? If you love nature, consider planting perennials for bees and butterflies. Send a friend a favorite book. Bring in your neighbor&rsquo;s garbage cans. Send a card full of encouragement to someone who needs it, or volunteer for your favorite organization. Time spent helping others is time well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Meditate</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So much of modern life is geared toward getting as much done as possible, which leads to increased stress and anxiety. Meditation is a way to use the breath to help calm the nervous system. When you breathe properly, the diaphragm stimulates the vagus nerve, which helps you connect to the parasympathetic system. Just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Seli/publication/315790389_Mindfulness_and_mind_wandering_The_protective_effects_of_brief_meditation_in_anxious_individuals/links/5bbcb45e92851c7fde373a67/Mindfulness-and-mind-wandering-The-protective-effects-of-brief-meditation-in-anxious-individuals.pdf\">10 minutes a day</a>&nbsp;can begin to change the patterns of your brain. While starting a meditation practice can feel challenging, here are some ideas on how to get started: Begin your day in silence, before you check your phone for emails or texts. Find a comfortable chair or go outside and find a peaceful spot where you can pause and bring awareness to your breath. Close your eyes and count your breaths for 10 minutes. You can also find many useful apps that will help guide your meditation practice, which can be particularly useful for beginners. While learning to meditate requires discipline and practice, it doesn&rsquo;t have to require a lot of time and you don&rsquo;t have to do it perfectly to reap the benefits.</p>\r\n', '07e63bd741d12de5585f49acec629cc6.png', '2020-11-01 21:32:03', 1, '2020-11-02 02:02:03', NULL),

Eat well.</strong>&nbsp;You can be a healthy role model for your kids &ndash; they follow your lead. If you aren&rsquo;t eating well, neither will they.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Exercise.&nbsp;</strong>Your children should see that mom values her health and enjoys exercise. Maybe your partner will also be inspired by your increased energy.

This small ritual can be quite replenishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.

If you don&rsquo;t have time for a mom&rsquo;s night out, consider an online coffee date. Oxytocin, our feel good hormone, spikes after childbirth and also during friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Laugh.</strong>&nbsp;Children laugh about 300 times per day, whereas adults laugh about five. Our entire sense of life lightens when we laugh. Listen to a podcast, get a joke of the day or just giggle with your kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Touch therapy.</strong>&nbsp; Feel-good hormones such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin&nbsp;are&nbsp; released from touch therapy such as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;massage. Consider it body maintenance!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Give Gratitude.</strong>&nbsp;Women who feel grateful have more energy and happiness.&nbsp; Create a gratitude journal and write in it each day. As a mom, the days are long, but the years go by far too fast. Being thankful may help you appreciate each day a little more.</p>\r\n', '2f9a7f58f1292e5978cbd9914f251d7a.png', '2020-11-01 21:58:19', 2, '2020-11-02 02:28:19', NULL),
(10, 4, 'What is Normal Growth?', 'What-is-Normal-Growth', '<p>Children tend to follow a constant genetically determined percentile curve on the growth chart. Growth occurs at a rate of about 2 &frac12; inches per year until early adolescence, when preteens achieve a peak growth velocity of about 4 inches per year. The growth spurt starts at about nine to 10 years in girls and peaks around 11 &frac12; to 12 years. Peak growth velocity typically occurs about 18 months before the first menstrual period; at the time of the first period, a female is within 1 to 2 inches of adult height. The male growth spurt generally starts at 11 and peaks around 13 &frac12; years, although growth continues well into late adolescence for most males.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many environmental factors influence whether a child achieves full genetic growth potential. For example, athletes who engage in intensive training more than 18 hours per week and who restrict or limit calories can negatively affect growth potential, as do preadolescents who show poor weight gain prior to peak growth velocity and overweight children who go through puberty early due to the effects of excess weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measured height and weight parameters can be used to calculate a child&rsquo;s body mass index (BMI). In adults, BMI ranges are set: greater than 25 is considered overweight and over 30 is considered &ldquo;obese.&rdquo; Children are continually growing and experience spurts at certain ages; for this reason, BMI is plotted on an age- and gender-appropriate growth chart.&nbsp;<strong>A BMI below 10 percent is considered underweight, 10 to 84 percent normal weight, 85 to 94 percent overweight, and &gt;95 percent &ldquo;obese.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;Even if a child is considered to have a normal BMI, a rapid change in trajectory across percentile lines may trigger further investigation into the cause of the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low BMI in children can be caused by genetic factors and a predisposition to be small. It may also be caused by an intentional restriction of calories by the child in response to perceived increased weight, or accidentally, as in very active children who do not eat enough to support physical demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BMI percentile norms are based on the distribution of children in 1976, when only 15 percent of children exceeded the 85th percentile. Now, more than 1/3 of children are classified as overweight or obese. Largely due to poor nutrition habits and low levels of physical activity, overweight children can suffer from a wide range of complications, including asthma, sleep apnea, infertility in girls, gallstones, liver dysfunction and bone fractures.</p>\r\n', 'noimage.jpg', '2020-11-01 21:59:44', 2, '2020-11-02 02:29:44', NULL);
